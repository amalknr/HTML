	<p style="color:blue;background:black;">The act of reading can help relieve stress levels and relax you. Reading can take your mind off of everyday worries, which can be a great way to reduce stress levels. Reading books is everything to me, it not only enhanced my vocabulary, and improved my sleep quality, but it also reduces my stress and tension.</p>
